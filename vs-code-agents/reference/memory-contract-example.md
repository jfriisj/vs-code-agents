# Flowbaby Memory Contract - Concrete Example

This document provides a concrete example of how to add Flowbaby memory to your custom agents. All of the agents in this repo already use this feature, but this document specifically calls out this one aspect of the agent.md files for reference.

You can copy/paste the markdown block below directly into any custom agent file in VS Code. You will need to install the Flowbaby memory extension from the VS Code extension marketplace for your agent to make use of these instructions.

## How to use this

1. Scroll to the "Copy this into your agent file" block below.
2. On GitHub, click the **copy** icon in the top-right of that block (or select all of its contents).
3. Paste into your `*.agent.md` file in VS Code.

Do **not** copy anything above or below that block.

# Unified Memory Contract (Role-Agnostic)

*For all agents using Flowbaby tools*

Using Flowbaby tools (`flowbaby_storeMemory` and `flowbaby_retrieveMemory`) is **mandatory**.

---

## 1. Retrieval (Just-in-Time)

* Invoke retrieval whenever you hit uncertainty, a decision point, missing context, or a moment where past work may influence the present.
* Additionally, invoke retrieval **before any multi-step reasoning**, **before generating options or alternatives**, **when switching between subtasks or modes**, and **when interpreting or assuming user preferences**.
* Query for relevant prior knowledge: previous tasks, preferences, plans, constraints, drafts, states, patterns, approaches, instructions.
* Use natural-language queries describing what should be recalled.
* Default: request up to 3 high-leverage results.
* If no results: broaden to concept-level and retry once.
* If still empty: proceed and note the absence of prior memory.

### Retrieval Template

```json
#flowbabyRetrieveMemory {
  "query": "Natural-language description of what context or prior work might be relevant right now",
  "maxResults": 3
}
```

---

## 2. Execution (Using Retrieved Memory)

* Before executing any substantial step—evaluation, planning, transformation, reasoning, or generation—**perform a retrieval** to confirm whether relevant memory exists.
* Integrate retrieved memory directly into reasoning, output, or decisions.
* Maintain continuity with previous work, preferences, or commitments unless the user redirects.
* If memory conflicts with new instructions, prefer the user and acknowledge the shift.
* Identify inconsistencies as discoveries that may require future summarization.
* Track progress internally to recognize storage boundaries.

---

## 3. Summarization (Milestones)

Store memory:

* Whenever you complete meaningful progress, make a decision, revise a plan, establish a pattern, or reach a natural boundary.
* And at least every 5 turns.

Summaries should be dense and actionable. 300–1500 characters.

Include:

* Goal or intent
* What happened / decisions / creations
* Reasoning or considerations
* Constraints, preferences, dead ends, negative knowledge
* Optional artifact links (filenames, draft identifiers)

End storage with: **"Saved progress to Flowbaby memory."**

### Summary Template

```json
#flowbabyStoreSummary {
  "topic": "Short 3–7 word title (e.g., Onboarding Plan Update)",
  "context": "300–1500 character summary capturing progress, decisions, reasoning, constraints, or failures relevant to ongoing work.",
  "decisions": ["List of decisions or updates"],
  "rationale": ["Reasons these decisions were made"],
  "metadata": {"status": "Active", "artifact": "optional-link-or-filename"}
}
```

---

## 4. Behavioral Expectations

* Retrieve memory whenever context may matter.
* Store memory at milestones and every 5 turns.
* Memory aids continuity; it never overrides explicit user direction.
* Ask for clarification only when necessary.
* Track turn count internally.
